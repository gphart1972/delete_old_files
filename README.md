This script was created to resolve a problem my last employer had, the dev team had created some special logging for their server app, but had now way to implment any sort of "circular logging" and the amount of log files was eating up the free space on the disk, after meeting with dev team and agreeing on how many days of logs they felt they neded to keep this script was used to keep the number of log files to that ammount without eating up all the disk space.
To use this file copy the code into your notepad app, edit the example path to fit yours and save as a powershell file.
To use this in the same manner we did, use the Windows "Task Scheduler" to run this daily.
